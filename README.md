This is a simple project aiming to create a note taking console app. 
This description must also be updated to look more fancy and representative. For now, it's enough. Have a nice day ;).

To-do list: 
1. Ability to create and read files.
2. Show a list of all created files and choose which one you want to edit.
3. Creating an interesting and eye-catching design(although it's in console.)
4. Ability to have date created and date last modified.
5. Word and symbol counter.
6. Sorting the list of files by last modified, name or date created.

Completed:
